        <p>Being Star-Lord, I often find myself with a need to get away to a private place to get away from it all. Ya know? I heard about Sputnik Realty at a bar in Morag. It sounded too good to be true to be honest. The prices were out of this world! Megan helped me design it just the way I wanted it. My planet looks like it came out of a Comet Book. -Peter Quill</p>

        <p>As a sloth, a lot of my friends wondered why I would need my own planet. However, I want a place where I can follow my Philislothical tendencies whilst sipping my gravi-tea. Being part of the Slotherin house, I decided to go with a green, black, and white color theme. I really wanted the planet to really support my lifestyle of "Live slow, die whenever." It was great hanging out with the crew at Sputnik Realty. -Sloth</p>

        <p>I had very specific requests for my planet, after all it was going to be my Just-Ice Base. The crew at Sputnik Realty really pulled through. I wanted there to be lots of sodium(Na) deposits and Joe said, "Not a problem!" and just like that they were there. The only thing that I just couldn't get over was the proximity to a Sirius star. I'm not joking that thing is as bright as the Knight is Dark. I ultimately let it go after a comment from my wife that brought back some happy memories ("Why so Sirius?"). Anyways, if you are going to invest in a custom planet Sputnik Realty is the way to go.- Bruce</p>
