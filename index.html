        <h3>Our Story</h3><!--Joe would you like this in a div or changed in any way?-->
        <p> Our company was founded on the idea that everyone should have a place to call their own. There is nothing quite like settling in at the end of a day in a place that is truly yours, is there? We all know the astronomical prices that other custom planet creation companies charge. Why it almost makes you want to take up your pirating career again. So, with that in mind we found a way to locally source all of our materials and labor. That way we not only provide you with the best price in the system but we also make jobs in the community. Our standards are not just up to code, they're the best in the business.</p>

      <div id="Joe">
        <div class="profilePics"><img src="joeProfilePic.jpg" alt="Joe"></div></div><!--feel free to change-->
        <p>Joe is the best Joe that has ever Joe-ed into existence. You need something that you think we might not be able to get? You need a core so huge that it makes Apollo shake in his sandals? You need your caves to be stocked with a little something extra? Joe knows a guy. Yeah, Joe knows a guy anything and everything.</p>

      <div id="Megan">
        <div class="profilePics"><img src="meganProfilePic.jpg" alt="Megan"></div><!--feel free to change-->
        <p>Megan can make your wildest design dreams appear right before your eyes. We don't even call what she does "magic" anymore because that downplays her masterpieces. Anything those other companies can make we can make and Megan can make them even better. There will never be a time that you look upon your planet and not be completely awed at the majesty that she created for you. We don't ask what type of dark powers she calls upon to pull together her designs for the prices that we have and we stopped asking.</p>
      </div><!--Megan-->
      <div id="Amari">
        <div class="profilePics"><img src="amariProfilePic.jpg" alt="Amari"></div>
        <p>Amari does things for the company that we can't really state here. Let's just say that the books are taken care of and that's all any of us need to know.</p>
